# Contributing Guidelines

Feel free to open pull requests to add new property wrappers (aka burritos!). In order to keep the project organized please follow those guidelines:
* 1 pull request for 1 property wrapper.
* Include a test for your wrapper covering, at least, its basic get/set logic.
* Follow the folder structure and name convention of:
   * `Sources/{PropertyWrapperStructName}/{PropertyWrapperStructName}.swift`
   * `Tests/{PropertyWrapperStructName}Tests/{PropertyWrapperStructName}Tests.swift`
* Add a `static var allTests = []` to your `XCTestCase` with references to your tests. Reference this property from both `LinuxMain.swift` and `XCTestManifests.swift`.
* Configure the `Package.swift` manifest with a new `.target` and `.testTarget`. Add the target to the library inside products.
* Update the `README.md` with a new section including a description and sample usage.
* Updated the `Burritos.podspec` with a new subspec for your wrapper pointing to the source files and listing the dependencies. Check existing wrappers as examples.

Feel free to open issues or pull requests for any other bug, improvement or fix.

Thank you.
